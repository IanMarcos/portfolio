Currently, I'm exploring the world of web development, but that's not necessarly the focus of my career. What I really love is coding solutions, imagining something, developing it, and having it turn out exactly as it was envisioned. Web development feels like the area that can bring the most growth in this stage of my career, but I definitely see myself exploring other areas in the long term. üßë‚Äçüíª",
